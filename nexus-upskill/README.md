# 🎓 Nexus Upskill - Backend API

> Learn through industry-level experts who teach real-world tech and help you build projects with proper guidance.

## 📋 Project Overview

Nexus Upskill is a full-stack e-learning platform designed with a **Layered Architecture** that ensures clean code separation and maintainability. The backend is built with **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, and **MongoDB**, while the frontend uses **Vanilla JavaScript** with a modular approach.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
Routes (Express endpoints)
    ↓
Controllers (Request handling & validation)
    ↓
Services (Business logic)
    ↓
Repositories (Database operations)
    ↓
MongoDB (Data persistence)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB)

### 2. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd nexus-upskill

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file from template
cp .env.example .env

# Update .env with your credentials
# - MONGODB_URI: Your MongoDB Atlas connection string
# - JWT_SECRET: Your secret key for JWT signing
# - ADMIN_UPI_ID: Admin's UPI ID for payment processing
```

### 3. Run the Server

```bash
# Development mode (with auto-reload)
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`

## 🔐 Security Features

### Authentication

- **JWT-based** authentication for stateless API
- **Password Hashing** using bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
- **Token Expiry** configurable (default: 7 days)

### Authorization

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - `Admin`: Full system control
  - `Teacher`: Create & manage courses, track earnings
  - `Student`: Enroll in courses, make payments

### Privacy Rules

- ✅ Teachers **cannot** see student phone numbers
- ✅ Students **cannot** see teacher phone numbers
- ✅ Only Admin has full visibility of all contact details
- ✅ Phone numbers are never exposed in API responses

## 💳 Payment Flow

1. **Student initiates purchase**
   - Clicks "Purchase" on a course
   - Sees Admin UPI ID & QR code
   - Enters transaction reference after payment

2. **Admin verifies payment**
   - Reviews pending payments in Admin Dashboard
   - Verifies bank account receipt
   - Clicks "Confirm" to approve

3. **System processes payment**
   - Calculates admin commission (default: 20%)
   - Marks enrollment as "Active"
   - Updates teacher with earnings

4. **Notifications sent**
   - Student: Course access unlocked
   - Teacher: Payment notification with amount

## 📊 Data Models

### User

- Name, Email, Password (hashed)
- Role: admin, teacher, student
- Phone (stored, but privacy-protected)
- Interests, LinkedIn/GitHub URLs
- UPI ID (teachers only)
- Company (employees only)

### Course

- Title, Description, Duration
- Teacher ID (reference)
- Price, Highlights, Status
- Trending flag (admin-only toggle)

### Enrollment

- Student → Course reference
- Status: pending, approved, active, completed
- Progress tracking (0-100%)

### Payment/Transaction

- Student, Teacher, Course references
- Amount, Commission calculation
- Transaction ID & screenshot URL
- Status tracking with timestamps

## 📝 Validation

Using **Zod** for type-safe validation:

- Request body validation
- Query parameter validation
- Conditional schemas (e.g., company required for employees)
